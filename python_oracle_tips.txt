Make sure you have a relatively current version of Python installed (say 3.6 or 3.7).

Make sure you have Oracle client software installed (Oracle Instant Client "Basic" or "Basic Light", or any Oracle database or full client installation).

Download the appropriate version of the Python cx_Oracle driver here: https://pypi.org/project/cx_Oracle/#files

For example, if you have installed Python 3.7, download the file "cx_Oracle-7.0.0-cp37m-win_amd64.whl".

Install the .whl file with pip:

    $ pip install cx_Oracle-7.0.0-cp37m-win_amd64.whl

Make sure you have appropriate entries in your tnsnames.ora file. The file should be located in your Oracle client or database installation. For me, it is C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\11.2.0\server\network\ADMIN...

GPDV1 =

  (DESCRIPTION =

    (ADDRESS_LIST =

      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = tcp)(HOST = gpdv1)(PORT = 1521))

    )

    (CONNECT_DATA =

      (SID = gpdv1)(UR = A)(SERVICE_NAME = gpdv1..world)

    )

  )

GPQA1 =

  (DESCRIPTION =

    (ADDRESS_LIST =

      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = tcp)(HOST = gpqa1)(PORT = 1522))

    )

    (CONNECT_DATA =

      (SID = gpqa1)(UR = A)(SERVICE_NAME = gpqa1..world)

    )

  )

GPPR1 =

  (DESCRIPTION =

    (ADDRESS_LIST =

      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = tcp)(HOST = gppr1)(PORT = 1521))

    )

    (CONNECT_DATA =

      (SID = gppr1)(UR = A)(SERVICE_NAME = gppr1..world)

    )

  )


At this point, you should be able to connect to Oracle with Python:


import cx_Oracle

conn = cx_Oracle.connect("<Oracle username>", "<password>", "GPDV1")
sql = "SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = '9106'"
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute(sql)

for item in cur:

    print(item)

cur.close()

conn.close()
